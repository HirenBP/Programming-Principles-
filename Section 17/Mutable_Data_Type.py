"""
Mutable data structures are data structures that can be changed after they are created.
Some of the examples of mutable data structures are , list, sets and byte arrays.
By change, we mean modify for example:

list1 = [1,2,3,4] to add number 5 to list you can use
list1.append(5)
This will add number 5 to list

Immutable data structures: These are data structures that do not allow you to modify their contents or state
after they are created. For example, tuples,numbers,boolean,bytes and frozen sets.For example :
string1 = 'Modules and Workshops World'
Because strings are immutable there is no way to modify value of string1.
string1 = 'Modules and Workshops name'
Above statement creates whole new reference to value ("Modules and Workshops name") and assigns it to variable string1
